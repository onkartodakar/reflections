How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
#Easier to find the bug rather than comparing line by line

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
#Would be easier to track changes and revert when necessary

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
#Pros : Control over content committed. 
#Cons : Saved content might not be the right point to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
#Git is designed for coding and assumes presence of multiple related files. Google docs on the other hand does not assume any relationship between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
#git log provides a list of all changes introduced and git diff enables us to compare and analyze those changes


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
